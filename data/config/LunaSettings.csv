[Index]: This is the default behavior. Tags are stored per ship and weapon group index. This is the most precise method, but if you refit a ship, you will need to redo tags lest you have nonsensical tags.

[WeaponComposition]: Tags are stored per ship by weapon composition. If you e.g. have a weapon group with railguns and light autocannons on a ship and refit it, such that the weapon group with those weapons gets a new index, you won't have to redo tags. On the other hand, if you e.g. remove the light autocannon, you will have to redo tags, since now the group will be composed of railguns rather than railguns and light autocannons.

[WeaponCompositionGlobal]: The same as WeaponComposition, but tags are NOT stored per ship. So if you e.g. set a weapon group containing only PD Lasers to PD, it will affect all your ships that have a weapon group containing only PD Lasers. This storage mode takes the least amount of effort, but also offers the least flexibility.",,"",,,Tags
