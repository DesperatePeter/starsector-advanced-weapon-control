    # to the same mode. Note that if both a direct match and regex match exist, the direct match will be used.
    # If multiple regex-matches exist, an arbitrary one will be chosen. Please be mindful of not adding regexes
    # that might match to other weapons (e.g. ".*h.*" would be a very bad idea to add...),
