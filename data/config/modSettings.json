      # Note: AdvancedGunneryControl preserves a weapons base AI and only uses its custom AI if the base AI

    # If you are a mod author, feel free to add suggested weapon tags to your modSettings.json,
    # simply map weapon ids to tags. For multiple tags for a single weapon, use a single string and separate
    # tags via comma. You may use regexes to map multiple variants of the same weapon
    # to the same mode. Note that if both a direct match and regex match exist, the direct match will be used.
    # If multiple regex-matches exist, an arbitrary one will be chosen. Please be mindful of not adding regexes
    # that might match to other weapons (e.g. ".*h.*" would be a very bad idea to add...).,
    # Please refer to the README.md (in repo base folder) for a description of available tags and what to use them for.
