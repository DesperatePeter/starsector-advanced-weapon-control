=== For Starsector 0.96a ===

- 1.12.4:
fix: compatibility issue with VAS (AGC will no longer wrap the AIs of blacklisted weapons in an empty wrapper)

- 1.12.3:
fix: crash when merging weapon group with alternating mode and then selecting that group
fix: slightly improved some descriptions in hover tooltips

- 1.12.2:
fix: AI-controlled ships now use their maneuver target as ship target for ShipTarget-Tag and Charge-ship-mode
fix: AvoidArmor tag now considers residual armor
fix: AGC-GUI now available in mission refit-screen simulations
fix: Opening combat-GUI via command HUD now only works when in command HUD, as intended
fix: Improve logic for PD-validity evaluation
fix: Performance issues

- 1.12.1:
fix: removing ForceAF as the last tag no longer makes it stick around.
fix: There should be less UI flicker now when setting all weapons to ForceAF tag. It doesn't seem possible to completely get rid of flicker.
fix: Combat GUI won't open anymore when an invalid ship (e.g. command shuttle) is selected.
fix: Crash when clicking suggested button on a ship with no fleet member value.
fix: suggested tags applied to ship modules would not get stored properly if exiting GUI after only pressing that button.
fix/feat: Selecting a ship in the command HUD (TAB-Key) now lets you open their GUI (experimental, uses reflection as this is not exposed by API).

- 1.12.0: This update will reset ship modes!
fix: possible crash when switching between advanced and simple mode
Add BlockBeams tag (only relevant for very specific weapons, mainly a weapon from an upcoming mod release)
Add Charge ship mode
Internal refactoring of ship modes. The way they were previously stored was kind of stupid. The main
effect of this is that you can now customize which ship modes will be available in the settings.
For mod authors, it's now also possible to assign ship modes via custom ship data.

- 1.11.2:
fix: no longer requires JRE8, selecting a new tag in the combat GUI no longer deselects invisible tags.
add settings for controlling in-combat-gui hover effects.
Note: Added a new parameter to ButtonGroupAction::execute in combatGuiLib-part.

- 1.11.1:
Fix potential memory leak caused by weapon highlighting when hovering over buttons for an extended period.

- 1.11.0: Requires 0.96a-RC10
Merge tag (Manually control multiple weapon groups at once), Prioritization tags

- 1.10.0:
Automatic tags: Add new GUI to customize suggested tags and option to apply them automatically

- 1.9.0:
Update for Starsector version 0.96a and updated library mods

UI improvements, combat GUI lib, tag scrollbar

- 1.1.x - 1.6.x:
