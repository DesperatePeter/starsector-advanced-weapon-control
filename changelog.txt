=== For Starsector 0.97a ===

- 1.17.1: hotfix
fix: Crash when accessing advanced setting tab in LunaSettings

- 1.17.0: Devastator Edition
feat: improve friendly fire logic for burst weapons with recoil (such as e.g. the Devastator Cannon)
note: this feature will likely need further refining in the future, but should be mostly functional
feat: add PrioDense tag (by default only in complete tag list), which prioritizes target dense areas
fix: campaign GUI options reset/copyLoadout/copyVariant should now work for all tag storage mode
fix: NPE when using automatic suggested tags on freshly acquired ship without weapons
fix: setting tags/modes for ship modules in the refit screen should now work properly
feat: ported additional settings to LunaSettings. If you want specific settings ported, please let me know!

- 1.16.1:
fix: Issue where index-based tag storage wasn't working for fighters anymore
fix: Issue that caused a CTD when using avoid phase tag against MSV ships with non-right-click phase cloak

- 1.16.0:
change: Changed default tag list to classic rather than novice in LunaSettings
feat: Improve target prioritization for the custom AI against stations
feat: add PrioHealthy tag (opposite of PrioWounded), available in tag list "complete" by default
feat: add LowRoF tag, which reduces the rate of fire of a weapon, available in tag list "complete" by default
fix: I heard you like fixes, so I fixed the fix that was supposed to fix phase ship recognition for phase tags

- 1.15.1:
fix: Issue with duplicate tags when customizing suggested tags, which would prevent removing tags once added
fix: Issue where target/avoid phase tags would consider ships with right-click defense systems other than phase cloak as phase ships
fix: issue where new tag storage modes didn't work during missions
change: Charge mode now ignores PD weapons*, i.e. ships will charge until all non-PD weapons are in range
*unless they have one of these tags: "NoPD", "NoMissiles", "PrioShips"

- 1.15.0: LunaSettings
feat: Add LunaLib integration for settings. Everything should still work without LunaLib
feat: Add different tag storage modes, selectable via LunaSettings or settings.editme
      Check out the Tab Tags in LunaSettings for more information!
      WeaponComposition mode allows for storing tags based on weapons in groups rather than group index
      WeaponCompositionGlobal allows to apply modes fleet-wide in an automated fashion

- 1.14.2 (hotfix):
fix: Issue that can cause a crash via stack overflow (log spammed with determineIfShotWillHit(AGCUtils.kt:379))

- 1.14.1:
fix: Issue with bounds detection that prevented weapons from firing

- 1.14.0:
Disclaimer: This version has been released very shortly after the new game version, so it might still contain issues
feat: update for new game version 0.97a
feat: add option to disable refit screen integration to Settings.editme
feat: add option (true by default) to use exact bounds rather than circle approximations to determine if weapons should fire
      This has not yet been tested sufficiently, so if this causes issues,
      please disable useExactBoundsForFiringDecision in Settings.editme and let me know!
feat: add new ship modes (KeepAway, FarAway and ShieldsUp+). FarAway is still in experimental stage
      ShieldsUp+ needs to be enables manually in Settings.editme.
      Depending on feedback, either KeepAway or FarAway will probably get removed, as they are different ways to achieve the same thing
feat: ship/station modules now use their parent ship/station to determine ship target for tags such as ShipTarget
fix: will no longer open refit screen integration GUI when typing J while naming ships

=== For Starsector 0.96a ===

- 1.13.1:
fix: refit-screen integration should now also work with JRE8

- 1.13.0:
feat: refit-screen integration
fix: screen scale mult issues

- 1.12.4:
fix: compatibility issue with VAS (AGC will no longer wrap the AIs of blacklisted weapons in an empty wrapper)

- 1.12.3:
fix: crash when merging weapon group with alternating mode and then selecting that group
fix: slightly improved some descriptions in hover tooltips

- 1.12.2:
fix: AI-controlled ships now use their maneuver target as ship target for ShipTarget-Tag and Charge-ship-mode
fix: AvoidArmor tag now considers residual armor
fix: AGC-GUI now available in mission refit-screen simulations
fix: Opening combat-GUI via command HUD now only works when in command HUD, as intended
fix: Improve logic for PD-validity evaluation
fix: Performance issues

- 1.12.1:
fix: removing ForceAF as the last tag no longer makes it stick around.
fix: There should be less UI flicker now when setting all weapons to ForceAF tag. It doesn't seem possible to completely get rid of flicker.
fix: Combat GUI won't open anymore when an invalid ship (e.g. command shuttle) is selected.
fix: Crash when clicking suggested button on a ship with no fleet member value.
fix: suggested tags applied to ship modules would not get stored properly if exiting GUI after only pressing that button.
fix/feat: Selecting a ship in the command HUD (TAB-Key) now lets you open their GUI (experimental, uses reflection as this is not exposed by API).

- 1.12.0: This update will reset ship modes!
fix: possible crash when switching between advanced and simple mode
Add BlockBeams tag (only relevant for very specific weapons, mainly a weapon from an upcoming mod release)
Add Charge ship mode
Internal refactoring of ship modes. The way they were previously stored was kind of stupid. The main
effect of this is that you can now customize which ship modes will be available in the settings.
For mod authors, it's now also possible to assign ship modes via custom ship data.

- 1.11.2:
fix: no longer requires JRE8, selecting a new tag in the combat GUI no longer deselects invisible tags.
add settings for controlling in-combat-gui hover effects.
Note: Added a new parameter to ButtonGroupAction::execute in combatGuiLib-part.

- 1.11.1:
Fix potential memory leak caused by weapon highlighting when hovering over buttons for an extended period.

- 1.11.0: Requires 0.96a-RC10

Automatic tags: Add new GUI to customize suggested tags and option to apply them automatically

- 1.9.0:
Update for Starsector version 0.96a and updated library mods
