# Advanced Weapon Control - Starsector Mod #

![Cover Image](imgs/agc.png "Cover Image")

This is a utility mod that allows you to set your auto-fire weapon groups to different modes.
For example, in PD-Only mode, weapons will ONLY fire at missiles and fighters, not at enemy ships.
There are many modes, check out the full list of available modes below!

Sections of this readme are roughly ordered by importance. For the most important stuff, stop after Settings.

Note: If you don't have a markdown renderer handy, you can read the online version at 
<https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/blob/master/README.md>

## TL;DR Instructions ##

- Press the "J" key in combat to open up a GUI (select an ally via "R" key beforehand to modify their modes)
- Press the "J" key in the campaign map to open a GUI
- By default, firing modes are automatically saved/loaded between combats (per ship)
- (optional) edit Starsector/mods/AdvancedGunneryControl/Settings.editme to customize the mod behavior.

## Installation ##

Simply download the latest release from <https://github.com/DesperatePeter/starsector-advanced-weapon-control/releases> 
and unzip it in your mods folder. 
If you install a new version, please make sure to delete the old folder before doing so. Backup you Settings.editme 
if you wish to keep it.

## Controls (Combat) ##

Press the "J"-Key to open up a GUI. This will pause the game and lock the camera. Press "J" again to close the GUI.

Target an ally ("R"-Key) **before** opening the GUI to instead adjust their modes.

In that GUI, you will be able to apply one or more tags to each weapon group. Each added tag will change the target 
priority of that weapon group and/or prevent it from firing in certain situations. Please note that a weapon group
will only fire if **all** suffixes allow firing, so if you e.g. set a weapon group to Hold(Flx>50%) and Fighters, it will
only fire when your ship's flux is below 50% and will only target fighters.
Rule of thumb: Usually, less is more. Don't set too many tags if you want your weapons to actually fire.
Note that tags only affect weapon groups set to autofire.

You can also set ship AI modes in a very similar fashion. These will only affect AI-controlled ships, not the player ship.

### Gunnery Control GUI ###

If you don't like having to set up your ships firing modes during (simulated) combat, there is also a campaign GUI available.
Simply press the "J"-Key while on the campaign map, and the interface will guide you through configuring your
firing modes. Unfortunately, I **can't directly interface with the ship refit screen**, which would be much better,
so this is the best I can do.

### Loadouts ###

You can define (by default 3) different mode loadouts for your fleet. You can then cycle through these loadouts for all
ships by pressing the "+"-Key in combat or clicking the corresponding button in the GUI. Doing so will switch all firing modes,
suffixes and ship modes to those defined in the next loadout. Loadouts are cycled fleet-wide, not per ship.

You can configure the number of available loadouts and their names in the Settings.editme file.

I would recommend leaving one loadout blank (i.e. everything default) for your entire fleet to give you a fallback option.

## Tags ##

Note: Not all tags are enabled by default, cf. Settings.editme to customize which tags are available
If you have ConsoleCommands installed, you can also hotload new tags via AGC_addTags.
Ship refers to a non-fighter ship in the table below
Replace N with a number between 1 and 99 when the tag name contains N%

## Settings ##

The settings allow you to configure many aspects of the mod.

Simply open the file ***Settings.editme*** (located in the folder of this mod) in a text editor of your choice 
and modify the lines marked with <---- EDIT HERE ----

Please be careful to adhere to the syntax and allowed values. If your settings file contains errors, the mod will use
the default settings instead! Make sure to check the log (Starsector/starsector.log) if your settings don't apply!

### Enable Custom AI ###

There are three different AI settings:

- If the custom AI is **disabled**, the weapon will use the baseAI to acquire a target. If the target doesn't match
  the tags, the weapon won't fire. (base AI)
- (default) If the custom AI is **enabled**, the weapon will first try the base AI. If the target doesn't 
  match the selected tags, the custom AI will take over. (custom AI)
- If you **force and enable** the custom AI, the weapon will immediately try to acquire a target via custom AI. (override AI)

You should **disable** the custom AI, if:

- You want an experience that is as close to vanilla Starsector as possible
- You absolutely hate it when your weapons occasionally fire at weird stuff (as my algorithm is still undergoing development, though mostly complete)

You should **enable or force-enable** the custom AI, if:

- You want to set weapons to prioritize targets they normally wouldn't (e.g. phase lances as anti-fighter weapons)
- You dislike it when your weapons don't fire even if there is a reasonable target
- You want to be able to customize the AI behaviour (in Settings.editme)
- You want to use advanced tags (Opportunist etc.)
- You want to get the "full experience"
- You want to help me improve my custom AI by sending me written reports/video snippets of glitchy weapon behaviour

### Performance Considerations ###

This mod will have a negative effect on performance. That effect will range from barely noticeable to considerable,
depending on the settings. On my machine (which is ~9 years old), the mod generally doesn't have a noticeable impact unless
I go crazy in the settings. Below I will list a few options for improving performance:

- Either force customAI, or disable it (as this prevents the occasional computation of two firing solutions).
- Try not to set every weapon group for every ship to a special fire mode.
- Leave the AI recursion level and friendly fire complexity at 1.
- Stick to ship mode Default (unfortunately, the ship mode implementation is a little hacky and performance intensive)

## How does the mod work? ##

In Starsector, each Weapon has a so-called AutofireAIPlugin. When that weapon is on autofire, this plugin will make the
decision where the weapon should aim and whether it should fire or not.

When you first set tags for a weapon, this mod will extract the original AutofireAIPlugin (AKA the base AI)
from the weapon and store it in a new Plugin called the TagBasedAIPlugin. Then, the selected tags are added to that plugin.
In each frame, the TagBasedAIPlugin will consult all tags and make decisions based on the combined results.

The TagBasedAIPlugin also contains a reference to the base Plugin. Each time the plugin has to make
a decision, it first asks the base plugin what it would like to do. If that behaviour is in line with the selected tags,
the plugin will simply let the base AI do its thing. Otherwise, depending on whether customAI is enabled or not, it will
tell the weapon to not fire, or try to come up with its own firing solution.

If the tag list for a weapon group is empty, the base AI will not be replaced.

Similarly, when setting ship AI modes, the mod will replace the base ship AI plugin with a custom plugin that will perform
some actions and then let the base AI take back over.

### Compatibility and Integration with other mods ###

Note: If you are unsure how anything in this section is supposed to work and need help, 
please feel free to DM me on Discord (Jannes on the unofficial Starsector Discord).

This mod should be compatible with other mods that provide custom AIs for their weapons, as long as they don't try to
manipulate the weapon AI mid-combat. This mod will simply use the custom AI of that weapon as the base AI.
This mod doesn't affect anything outside of combat, so it's very unlikely to cause problems on the campaign level.

#### Weapon Blocklist ####

If you are a mod-author and want to explicitly tell my mod to not tweak the AI of your weapon(s), include the weapon id
into your mod's modSettings.json:

```json
{
  "AdvancedGunneryControl": {
    "weaponBlacklist": [
      "weapon_id_1", "weapon_id_2"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Suggested Tags ####

Similarly, this mod has a feature for suggested tags for weapons. If you want to include suggested tags for your
weapons to allow users to quickly or automatically set up their tags, include a key suggestedWeaponTags in your modSettings.json.
Have a look at this mod's modSettings.json for an example. Refer to the tag table above to decide on tags.
If in doubt, the safe bet is always to simply omit a weapon and assign no tags.

A simple modSettings.json that only includes suggested tags would look like this:

```json
{
  "AdvancedGunneryControl": {
    "suggestedWeaponTags" : {
      "my_awesome_pd_also_weapon_id": "PrioritisePD,PrioMissile",
      "my_needler_style_weapon_id": "TargetShields"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Assigning tags to enemy ship weapons ####

If you want enemy ships of your mod to have tags assigned to their weapons, you can tell my mod to do so by setting
custom data to the ship. You can do that however you want to, the easiest solutions probably being a hullmod-script
or a BaseEveryFrameCombatPlugin/BaseEveryFrameCombatScript.

Use the setCustomData-method of the ShipAPI. Use the key "AGC_ApplyCustomOptions" and a Map<String, List<String>> as the value.
My mod will parse that value, apply the desired tags to the applicable weapons (Note: Tags are applied on a per-weapon basis
rather than on a per-weapon-group basis for enemy ships) and then remove the entry from the custom ship data.
After it's finished, it will write the key "AGC_CustomOptionsHaveBeenApplied" to the custom data, so you can search
for that key to see if tags have already been applied to a ship (though my mod doesn't check that key).

The map must adhere to the following syntax:

Its keys can be:
- a weapon id -> will affect all weapons with exactly this id
- "!MAGIC!Missile", "!MAGIC!Energy" or "!MAGIC!Ballistic" -> will affect all missiles/energy weapons/ballistics
- a regex-string -> will affect all weapons with ids that match the regex

The values must be lists of tag-names.
All tags listed will be applied to all weapons that match the given key.

For instance, if you want all missile weapons to receive the ForceAF and NoFighters tags, the following call should get the job done:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
// assuming ship is an object of type ShipAPI
ship.setCustomData("AGC_ApplyCustomOptions", mapOf("!MAGIC!Missile" to listOf("ForceAF", "NoFighters")))
```

```java
// Java
// assuming ship is an object of type ShipAPI
ship.setCustomData("AGC_ApplyCustomOptions", Collections.singletonMap("!MAGIC!Missile", Arrays.asList("ForceAF", "NoFighters")));
```

If you want to apply this via Hullmod, the hullmod effect could look something like this:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
class ExampleTagSettingHullmod : BaseHullMod {
    // we only care to write to ship data in combat (after the ship is spawned), not before that or in the campaign
    override fun applyEffectsAfterShipCreation(ship: ShipAPI?, id: String?) {
        if(ship != null){// nullptr check just to be safe (I know, this is not the Kotlin-way, but easier to read for Java devs :P)           
            val tagMap = mapOf(
                "!MAGIC!Missile" to listOf("ForceAF", "NoFighters") // set all missiles to ForceAF and NoFighters
                , "hveldriver" to listOf("TargetShields") // set all hyper-velocity drivers to TargetShields
                , ".*flak" to listOf("PD") // all weapons with IDs ending in flak (vanilla: single + dual flak) to PD 
            )
            ship.setCustomData("AGC_ApplyCustomOptions", tagMap)
        }
        // apply other effects your hullmod might have below this, as usual
    }
    
    // override other methods as required, as per usual
    // [...]
}
```

If you want to check whether AGC has been installed/loaded by the user:
It will write the key "AGC_Present" to the CombatEngine custom data. Though there's usually no harm in simply setting the ship
custom data. If AGC is present, it will handle it, if not, it won't have any effect.

#### Assigning ship modes to enemy ships ####

You can also assign ship modes to enemy ships in a very similar fashion. Since ship modes are assigned on a per-ship basis
rather than a per-weapon basis, this is much simpler. Instead of writing a map to custom data, you simply need to write a
list of ship modes to assign.

Use the key "AGC_ApplyCustomShipModes" and a List<String> as the value. 
For instance, assigning the SpamSystem mode to an enemy ship could be achieved with the following code:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
ship.setCustomData("AGC_ApplyCustomShipModes", listOf("SpamSystem"))
```

```java
// Java
ship.setCustomData("AGC_ApplyCustomShipModes", Arrays.asList("SpamSystem");
```

Same as before, after finishing the mode application, "AGC_CustomOptionsHaveBeenApplied" will be written to the ship's
custom data and the original entry will be removed.

#### Using the combat gui library ####

I wrote a repo-internal library that's used to implement the AGC in-combat GUI. You can import the library
from the package com.dp.advancedgunnerycontrol.combatgui. The AGC-implementation is in the subfolder agccombatgui.
Everything else is part of the library.
To use the library, add AGC as a dependency to your mod and load the AGC-jar.
In the future I might move this to a library-mod. If any lib-collection maintainer would be interested in including this,
please let me know!
You can find a usage example of the library here: <https://github.com/DesperatePeter/test-combat-gui-lib>

## Known Issues ##

- Versions before 0.8.2 saved custom classes as persistent data, meaning it was not possible to remove the mod.
